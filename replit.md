# Survey Builder Pro

## Overview

Survey Builder Pro is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed as a professional survey creation tool. The application is currently in its initial setup phase, featuring a clean, modern interface with offline capabilities. The project is structured as a client-side application with PWA features including service worker caching, offline functionality, and responsive design.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Design Pattern**: Single-page application with progressive enhancement
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design principles, gradients, animations, and responsive layouts
- **PWA Features**: Service worker implementation for offline functionality and caching

### Offline-First Approach
- **Service Worker**: Implements caching strategies for core application files
- **Offline Page**: Dedicated offline experience when network is unavailable
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cache versioning and cleanup of outdated resources

## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`index.html`)
- **Purpose**: Primary landing page and application entry point
- **Features**: 
  - PWA manifest integration
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - Custom favicon and app icons
  - Modern CSS animations and transitions

### 2. PWA Manifest (`manifest.json`)
- **Purpose**: Defines PWA installation and behavior characteristics
- **Configuration**:
  - App metadata and branding
  - Display modes and orientation preferences
  - Icon definitions for various screen sizes
  - Shortcuts for quick actions
  - Screenshot definitions for app stores

### 3. Service Worker (`sw.js`)
- **Purpose**: Handles caching, offline functionality, and background sync
- **Caching Strategy**: 
  - Cache-first approach for static assets
  - Network-first with cache fallback for dynamic content
  - Automatic cache versioning and cleanup

### 4. Offline Experience (`offline.html`)
- **Purpose**: Provides user-friendly offline experience
- **Features**: 
  - Consistent branding with main application
  - Clear messaging about offline status
  - Animated visual elements for better UX

## Data Flow

### Current State
The application is in initial setup phase with no complex data flow implemented yet. The basic flow includes:

1. **Initial Load**: User accesses the application through `index.html`
2. **Service Worker Registration**: PWA capabilities are enabled
3. **Caching**: Static assets are cached for offline access
4. **Offline Handling**: Service worker serves cached content or offline page when network is unavailable

### Future Considerations
The architecture is prepared for expansion with:
- Survey creation and management functionality
- Data persistence layer (likely browser storage or external database)
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time survey responses and analytics

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **http-server**: Development server for local testing and development
- **No external CDNs**: All assets are self-contained for better offline experience

### PWA Standards Compliance
- **Web App Manifest**: Follows W3C specifications
- **Service Worker API**: Implements standard caching and offline strategies
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Static Hosting Ready**: Application can be deployed to any static hosting service
- **PWA Capabilities**: Full PWA features including installability and offline access
- **Development Server**: Uses http-server for local development

### Scalability Considerations
The current architecture supports easy scaling through:
- CDN deployment for global distribution
- Static site hosting platforms (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- Integration with backend services for data persistence
- Database integration preparation (architecture suggests potential Drizzle ORM usage)

### Performance Optimizations
- Inline SVG icons for faster loading
- CSS animations using hardware acceleration
- Efficient caching strategies
- Minimal external dependencies

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
